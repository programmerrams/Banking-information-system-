        </h2>
        <p>
          A: Yes! While we offer specialized loans for mortgages and auto

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>
          Q: What is the difference between a mortgage loan and an auto loan?
        </h2>
        <p>
          A: A mortgage loan is used to purchase or refinance a home, while an
          auto loan is specifically for purchasing or refinancing a vehicle.
          Each comes with different interest rates and terms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: How do I apply for a mortgage?</h2>
        <p>
          A: To apply for a mortgage, we need information on the property, your
          income, credit score, and any down payment you can provide. We also
          assess your ability to repay the loan over the term.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: What do I need to get approved for an auto loan?</h2>

          A: For an auto loan, we require your credit score, income
          verification, and details about the vehicle you intend to purchase
          (e.g., price, make, and model).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: Can I make early payments on my loan?</h2>
        <p>
          A: Yes, you can make early repayments without penalty. In fact, paying
          early can help reduce the total interest you’ll pay over the life of
          the loan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: How do I check my loan or credit status?</h2>

          dashboard.
